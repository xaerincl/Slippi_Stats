# Slippi_Stats


# Installation
Requires Python >= 3.7. 

It needs both py-slippi and pandas, install:

```
$ pip install py-slippi
$ pip install pandas
```


# Usage

```
$ python slippi_csv.py -folder <path to your replay folder>
```

It can be a relative path or full path. For example if you place the .py file inside the Documents folder (assuming that the Slippi folder with the replays is indeed inside the Documents folder), you can just run:

```
$ python slippi_csv.py -folder Slippi
```

# Output

It will generate a .csv in the same folder as the .py file named Slippi_stats.csv
